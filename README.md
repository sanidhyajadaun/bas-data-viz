## 📋Usage
- First, make sure that the data is in a format that can be read by Pandas (CSV, Excel, etc.).
- Run the command python dataviz.py in the terminal. This will start the web server and open the app in your browser.
- The app will display a dropdown menu to select the report type, and a dropdown to choose the specific year. Once the options are selected, you will be able to see the plots.
- Plotted plot types: <br>
-> Line plot <br>
-> Scatter plot <br>
-> Bar chart <br>
-> Histogram <br>
-> Pie chart <br>
